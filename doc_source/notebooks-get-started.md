| Amazon SageMaker Studio Notebooks is in preview release and is subject to change\. | 

 To get started with Amazon SageMaker Studio notebooks you need to set up AWS SSO if you haven’t already\. You don’t have to be in an organization to use AWS SSO\. You can sign up as an individual or as an enterprise\. The process is similar except enterprises have the option of batch loading their users from their existing AWS SSO organization\. 

 If your organization has already set up a team and you were invited to join the organization or view a specific notebook, you can log in and use the Amazon SageMaker Studio dashboard\. From there you can try a tutorial that walks you through all of the features of Amazon SageMaker Studio, including how to use Amazon SageMaker Studio notebooks\.
