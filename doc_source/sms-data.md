# Use Input and Output Data<a name="sms-data"></a>

The input data that you provide to Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth is sent to your workers for labeling\. You choose the data to send to your workers by creating a manifest file that defines the data that requires labeling\.

The output data is the result of your labeling job\. The output data file contains one entry for each object in the input dataset that specifies the label\.
