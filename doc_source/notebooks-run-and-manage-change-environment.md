| Amazon SageMaker Studio Notebooks is in preview release and is subject to change\. | 

 You can change the notebook’s kernel in the same way that you change the kernel for any standard Jupyter notebook\.  

 **To change a notebook’s environment** 
+ In the top\-right corner of the JupyterLab UI, choose the kernel name\.  
+ Choose from the drop\-down list the environment that fits your need\. As described previously, you are choosing a kernel that is part of an environment\. For example, if you switch from Python 3 \(Data Science\) to Python 3 \(TensorFlow CPU Optimized\), you load your notebook in the TensorFlow CPU Optimized environment with a Python 3 kernel\.
