# Built in Task Types<a name="sms-task-types"></a>

Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth has eight built in task types\. These are image\- and text\-based labeling jobs that use Amazon SageMaker built in algorithms\. Ground Truth provides worker task templates in the console for built in task types\. The following topics describe each built in task type and demo the worker task templates that are provided by Ground Truth in the console\. To learn how to create a labeling job in the console using one of these task types, see [Getting started](sms-getting-started.md)\. 

If you are creating a labeling job using the API, you will need to provide a custom worker task template\. To learn how to create a custom template, see [Creating Custom Labeling Workflows](sms-custom-templates.md)\. For a repository of demo templates for a variety of labeling job task types, see [Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth Sample Task UIs ](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-sagemaker-ground-truth-task-uis)\.
