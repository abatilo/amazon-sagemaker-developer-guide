# React to Amazon SageMaker Job Status Changes with CloudWatch Events<a name="cloudwatch-events"></a>

To react to a status change in a Amazon SageMaker training, hyperparameter tuning, or batch transform job, create a rule in CloudWatch Events that use the **SageMaker Training Job State Change**, **SageMaker Hyperparameter Tuning Job State Change**, or **SageMaker Transform Job State Change** event type as the event source for the rule\. 

Every time the status of a Amazon SageMaker job changes, it triggers an event that CloudWatch Events monitors, and you can create a rule that calls a AWS Lambda function when the status changes\. For information about the status values and meanings for Amazon SageMaker jobs, see the following:
