# Monitoring a Model in Production<a name="how-it-works-model-monitor"></a>

After you deploy a model into your production environment, Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor can be used to continuously monitor the quality of Amazon SageMaker machine learning models\. It enables developers to set alerts for when there are deviations in the model quality, such as data drift and anomalies\. Early and pro\-active detection of these deviations enables you to take corrective actions\. For more information, see [Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor](model-monitor.md) \.
